# NBA full 48 minutes average

# ---
# ## CodeWars Description
# An NBA game runs 48 minutes (Four 12 minute quarters). Players do not typically play the full game, subbing in and out as necessary. Your job is to extrapolate a player's points per game if they played the full 48 minutes.
# Write a function that takes two arguments, ppg (points per game) and mpg (minutes per game) and returns a straight extrapolation of ppg per 48 minutes rounded to the nearest tenth. Return 0 if 0.
# Examples:
# pointsPer48(12, 20) // 28.8
# pointsPer48(10, 10) // 48
# pointsPer48(5, 17) // 14.1
# pointsPer48(0, 0) // 0
# Notes:
# All inputs will be either be an integer or float.

def nba_extrap(ppg, mpg):
    if mpg == 0:
        return 0
    return round((ppg * 48) / mpg,1)
