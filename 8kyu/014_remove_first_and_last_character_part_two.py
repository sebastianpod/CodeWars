# Remove First and Last Character Part Two

# ---
# ## CodeWars Description
# This is a spin off of my first kata.
# You are given a string containing a sequence of character sequences separated by commas.
# Write a function which returns a new string containing the same character sequences except the first and the last ones but this time separated by spaces.
# If the input string is empty or the removal of the first and last items would cause the resulting string to be empty, return an empty value (represented as a generic value NULL in the examples below).
# Examples
# "1,2,3"      =>  "2"
# "1,2,3,4"    =>  "2 3"
# "1,2,3,4,5"  =>  "2 3 4"
#
# ""     =>  NULL
# "1"    =>  NULL
# "1,2"  =>  NULL

# ## Solution

def array(strng):
    return ' '.join(strng.split(',')[1:-1]) or None
