# sum the strings

# ---
# ## CodeWars Description
# Create a function that takes 2 integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):
# Example: (Input1, Input2 -->Output)
# "4",  "5" --> "9"
# "34", "5" --> "39"
# "", "" --> "0"
# "2", "" --> "2"
# "-5", "3" --> "-2"
# Notes:
# If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.

# ---
# ## Solution

def sum_str(a, b):
    return '0' if a == '' and b == '' else a if b == '' else b if a == '' else str(int(a) + int(b))
